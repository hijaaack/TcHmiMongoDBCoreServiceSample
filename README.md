## TcHmiMongoDBCoreServiceSample
This is a sample TwinCAT HMI project that uses the MongoDBCoreService extension.
The sample shows how to use the extension in different ways. 

For the source code for MongoDBCoreService check this [repo](https://github.com/hijaaack/MongoDBCoreService)

## Prerequisites
MongoDB Server (sample tested with Community Server v6.0.5)

License: [TF2200](https://www.beckhoff.com/sv-se/products/automation/twincat/tfxxxx-twincat-3-functions/tf2xxx-tc3-hmi/tf2200.html) is needed in the HMI-Server to be able to use this C# Server Extension.

(No license is needed when testing this in the LiveView)

## Get Started
This sample is used with the MongoDB Community Server (tested with v6.0.5)
Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

To mimic the sample, open MongoDB Compass and connect to your MongoDB. Once connected create a new database with the name "**test**" and then add a new collection named "**carData**".

Once the "**carData**" is created select it and import JSON file and add the dummy data that is included in the project "**carDataOutput.json**"

When you open the sample project make sure the MongoDBCoreService has the correct configuration.
